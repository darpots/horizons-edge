# Horizons Edge

This theme seemed to evolve over time. Originally based on a Darcula theme it has now taken on it's own life and transformed to look totally different.

Originally created as a personal theme for me but happy for anyone to use if they like it.

The theme is heavily Javascript centric and has not been specifically modified for other languages.
