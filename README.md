# Horizons Edge

This theme just seemed to evolve over time. Originally based on a Darcula theme, it has now transformed to look totally different.

Created as a personal theme for me, but if anyone likes it then feel free to try it.

The theme is heavily Javascript centric, particularly React and Svelte as those are the 2 most common libraries I use personally.
